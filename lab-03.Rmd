### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```

# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

The size of the speech bubbles are not proportionate to the number of speakers of the language.





## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

By population density and total area are both measured into a pie chart which is confusing to which variable is actually being measured.




## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

Data looks clear but needs clarification on what the size of each country's circle means.




## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

Clear data with different colours for each observation meaning the data visualisation is effective.





# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?
- Wide format data doesn't contain repeating values and each row represents one subject's repeated responses. Wide format is easy to read and suitable for row calculations.
- Long format data has repeating values in its first column. Each row represents a single point in time per subject.

Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?

The format of 'staff' is wide. 

How many observations are there in the data set?




## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}
## Uncomment and complete the following code

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = `1975`:`2011`, 
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )
staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -faculty_type, 
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )

```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()
